# Colorslice: manipulate color in an intuitive, discoverable, joy-inducing way.

# Possible feature todos
## hard?
- color changing e.g. turn a range of blue in the image to red
    - change that color only in certain parts of the image
- gradient picking, with CSS3 output

## UI hard?

- support for formulas e.g. based on red, generate colors for link, link:active,
  link:focus, link:visited.

## not too difficult
- complementary colors
- intelligent darken/lighten button
- colors in URL
    - image uploaded, included in URL, so can link to both color palette and
      image
- sample a larger, averaged patch of pixels instead of just one pixel.
- layout that fully uses screen-space

## Backend todos
- use hapi.js
- use stylus
- use browserify
- maybe use one of the component framework things, if browserify doesnt have it

## Measuring success
- over-the-shoulder sessions with designers (some RISD friends of mine)
- google analytics
- whether I accomplish the features (that we choose to be most important)
